# Hi there 👋 I am Deniz :) 

I used to work as a Biochemist and I am currently a **Data Science** student at Data Sceince Tech Institute (DSTI) which is an applied Msc Science in France. I will have my diploma soon (May 2022 🌱 )  

This is my personal Github page where I gather some mini-projects that I do on my spare time. 

I am currently working on:

* Artificial Neural Networks
* Computer vision
* Time-series
* Agent-based modelling
* Graph databases (especially Neo4j - Just obtained the certification!! 😄)
* Cybersecurity

You can check out the latest project I have been involved in, [here!] (https://github.com/DSTI-ClickLearn/ClickLearn_DSTI_Project)
